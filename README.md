# Dotfiles

A repository for more sophisticated configurations of applications I use on a
daily basis. My philosophy is to find a good balance between functionality and
eye-candy, while keeping an eye on resource consumption. I put a lot of care
into a consistent and appealing look and try to use the
[gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) colorscheme for everything.

## Installation

For tinkering this repository and its submodules can be cloned with the
following command:
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/DrCracket/dotfiles
```

Alternatively it can be installed as a bare git repository, inspired by [this
Hacker News comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11070797). The
following
[script](https://gist.github.com/potamides/385866f8380ec65f40de734c53147040)
places administrative files in `$HOME/.dotfiles` and updates configurations in
`$HOME` with the content of the repository (**warning:** this overwrites
existing files):
```sh
#!/bin/bash

set -o errexit
export GIT_WORK_TREE=$HOME
export GIT_DIR=$GIT_WORK_TREE/.dotfiles

git clone --bare https://github.com/potamides/dotfiles.git $GIT_DIR
git config status.showUntrackedFiles no
git sparse-checkout set '*' '!README.md' '!.rice.png'
git checkout --force
git submodule update --init
```

This repository consists of configuration files for the following mentioned
applications, so make sure those are installed. For each application some more
or less detailed instructions are provided to get everything up and running.
All applications use [Sauce Code Pro Nerd
Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/SourceCodePro)
as a monospaced font and [DejaVu Sans](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/) as a
variable-width font, so make sure those are installed as well.

### Neovim ([.config/nvim](.config/nvim/))
To set up my neovim configuration the
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) plugin manager is required. To
install it simply run the following command.

```sh
curl -fLo ~/.local/share/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

After setting it up launch neovim and run the command `:PlugInstall` to install
all other plugins. Now restart neovim and everything should be working.

### Bash ([.inputrc](.inputrc), [.bashrc](.bashrc), [.bash\_profile](.bash_profile))
If available, the bash configuration sources
[bash-completions](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion) and
[complete-alias](https://github.com/cykerway/complete-alias) to get command
line completions. The former is available as an official package in Archlinux
and the latter can be found in the AUR. To integrate git into the prompt
[git-prompt](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh)
is used, it should already be installed along with git.
The configuration also makes use of neofetch.

### Neofetch ([.config/neofetch](.config/neofetch))
Neofetch is configured to be used as a terminal greeter. It displays [fortune
cookies](https://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/fortune-mod/), so make
sure the package is installed (available with pacman).
[Boxes](https://boxes.thomasjensen.com/) is also required for the terminal
greeter (an AUR package exists).

### Awesome ([.config/awesome](.config/awesome), [.xinitrc](.xinitrc), [.Xresources](.Xresources))
Awesome uses [mpv](https://mpv.io/) internally to play remote mpd streams.
Other integrated applications are only used in some keybindings and are thus
more or less optional or easily replaced. Take a look at calls to
[awful.spawn](https://awesomewm.org/doc/api/libraries/awful.spawn.html) in the
[rc.lua](.config/awesome/rc.lua) config file, it should be rather obvious. To
get GTK applications to match the colorscheme as close as possible install
[arc-gruvbox-theme](https://github.com/cyrinux/arc-gruvbox-theme) (can be found
in the AUR) and
[Papirus-Dark](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme)
(official Archlinux package exists). To understand how to control my awesome
configuration take a look at
[modalawesome](https://github.com/DrCracket/modalawesome).

### Conky ([.conkyrc](.conkyrc))
Conky makes use of
[absolutely-proprietray](https://github.com/vmavromatis/absolutely-proprietary)
to display the current Stallman Freedom Index. This package can be found in the
AUR.

### Alacritty ([.config/alacritty](.config/alacritty)), Ranger ([.config/ranger](.config/ranger)), Tmux ([.tmux.conf](.tmux.conf))
Some of these applications don't have additional dependencies and if they have,
they are integrated as git submodules or git subtrees so no additional steps
are required.

### Scripts ([.local/bin](.local/bin)), Systemd Service Files ([.config/systemd/user](.config/systemd/user))
These folders contain some useful shell scripts and systemd service files,
which don't necessarily belong to any of the aforementioned programs.
